Welcome to my page! I am currently a first-year PhD student of Data Science and Engineering (DSE) at the Bredesen Center of the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Prior to my comeback to school, I took position as a Scientific Research Programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, working closely with Dr. Sen, Saunak and Dr. Farage, Gregory to develop efficient algorithms for high-throughput data in GWAS and write them into Julia code. Check out the lab's page [SenResearch](http://www.senresearch.org/) to learn more about the lab's exciting works.
 
Originally from Kunming, Yunnan, China, I initially moved to College Park in Maryland in 2016 to start working towards my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Maryland (UMD). After graduated from UMD in 2020, I studied as a master's student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington to further expanding my knowledge and skills in applying statistics in biomedical fields.

As (always) a student, I am interested in learning about new and classic statistical methods, which include but not limited to modern ML/DL algorithms and Bayesian statistics in general. I enjoy coding and developing statistical methods as applicable, easy-to-use software packages for address real problems. The page lists some of my important works. Feel free to take a look and reach out to me if you ever have any questions!
