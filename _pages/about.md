Welcome to my page! I am a second year PhD student of Data Science and Engineering (DSE) at the Bredesen Center of the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Hector Santos-Villalobos](https://www.eecs.utk.edu/people/hector-santos-villalobos/) to research into multimodal systems, focusing on their applications in the field of medical imaging. Prior to my comeback to school, I worked full-time as a Scientific Research Programmer of the [SenResearch](http://www.senresearch.org/) lab led by [Dr. Åšaunak Sen](https://www.uthsc.edu/faculty/profile/?netid=ssen6) at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC), where I contributed primarily to the development of computationally efficient methods for analyzing high-throughput data in genome-wide association studies.
 
I am originally from Kunming city (the capital of Yunnan province in China), which is a city surrounded by hills and mountains. My first stop in the US was in College Park, Maryland, where I completed my undergraduate study in applied mathematics at the University of Maryland (UMD). After graduated from UMD, I continued my master's study in biostatistics at the University of Washington, to further expand my knowledge and skills in applying statistics in the biomedical fields.

As a student, I enjoy learning about new and classic statistical/ML/DL methods and implementing them into usable software applications or using programming to solve real problems. While I am not working/studying, I like to perform various of sports activities (e.g., swimming, weight training, skiing/biking when there is/is no snow). I am also a music and video game lover. Let's connect!
