Welcome to my page! I am currently a first-year PhD student of Data Science and Engineering (DSE) at the Bredesen Center of the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Prior to my comeback to school, I worked full-time as a Scientific Research Programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, under the supervision of Dr. Saunak Sen, to develop and implement efficient computational methods for processing high-throughput data in genome-wide association studies. Check out the lab's page [SenResearch](http://www.senresearch.org/) to learn more about the lab's exciting works.
 
I am originally from Yunnan province in China, and my hometown, Kunming, is a city surrounded by hills and mountains, and with similarly beautiful landscapes as Knoxville, where I currently live. I initially moved to Maryland state in the US in 2016, to start my undergraduate study in mathematics at the University of Maryland. After graduated in 2020, I continued my master's study in biostatistics at the University of Washington, to further expand my knowledge and skills in applying statistics in the biomedical fields.

As a student, I enjoy learning about new and classic statistical/ML/DL methods and implementing them into usable software applications or using programming to solve real problems. Besides work, I like to do sports and play Nintendo games.
