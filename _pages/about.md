Welcome to my page! I am currently a Scientific Research Programmer at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, working closely with Dr. Sen, Saunak and Dr. Farage, Gregory in the lab [SenResearch](http://www.senresearch.org/). 

Enjoying my 7th year in the US, I initially moved to College Park in Maryland from China in 2016 and then finished my undergraduate study in mathematics at the University of Maryland (UMD) in 2020. After my graduation from UMD I spent the next two years at the University of Washington and obtained a master in science degree in biostatistics in 2022 (so I got both of my degrees so far during the COVID-19 pandemic :( ). I am interested in developing statistical methods and software applications for answering questions motivated by real problems, particularly in the fields of public health. Currently, I am working on implementing efficient applications of linear mixed models to perform genome-scans of large scales.
